# 🧠 Fine-Tuning GPT-2 Medium for Custom Q&A

This project fine-tunes a GPT-2 Medium model on a custom question-answer dataset and allows interactive querying after training. It is built for experimentation and learning on a modest GPU setup (e.g., Tesla T4).

## 🚀 Training the Model

1. Ensure `qa_data.json` contains question-answer pairs:

```json
{
  "question": "What is the result of the milk test on dog X?",
  "answer": "Fat: 55.5 %, Lactose: 44.8 g/dL"
}
```

2. Run the training:

```bash
python train.py
```

3. The model and tokenizer will be saved under `model_output/`.

## 💬 Asking Questions

Use `ask.py` to query the fine-tuned model:

```bash
python ask.py
```

Example:

```
Question: What are the results of the blood test performed on Gol_9 on 2024-02-23?
Answer: Calcium: 67.53 mg/dL, Fat: 41.42 %, ...
```

## 🛠️ Requirements

Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install transformers datasets torch
```

## 🔮 Future Ideas

* Integrate Whisper for voice input
* Use LLaMA-2 (7B Q4) for better responses
* Add customer\_db + RAG to retrieve real user records dynamically
* Build a real-time customer support assistant
